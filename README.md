# Twenty Twenty Font Fix

This WordPress plugin is a temporary solution for the font rendering issue introduced in Chrome 79.0.3945.88.

Please note that this solution was quickly made for a specific use case and may not work for your site. This plugin currently only works if your site has [classic-editor](https://wordpress.org/plugins/classic-editor/) activated and do not care about removing editor styles.
